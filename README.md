# Guessing Game

This is a little number guessing game I wrote while learning Rust.   
I followed the guide found in Chapter 2 of [_The Rust Programming Language Book_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).  

## Getting Started  

- Run `cargo run`
- Have fun!  

## Resources
